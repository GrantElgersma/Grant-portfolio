Since 2001, it has become one of the most-used XML formats in technical communication. DITA is useful for structuring content, especially in large companies where information is often re-used in multiple outputs. DITA follows the single-sourcing method for managing content, where information is written in small chunks and then structured according to XML syntax. XML is a markup language that organizes content with tags and data that are defined as topics written and combined to fit a range of contexts. Markdown was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz to be an easy markup language for the average person to use. It became popular among web writers and rose in popularity among technical communicators because it made the process of formatting text quicker and works well in the world of web and app development. Markdown allows a writer to create headers, lists, word emphasis, and code blocks without lifting the hands from a keyboard. DITA vs. Markdown Technical communicators have sometimes disagreed about whether DITA or Markdown should be used for documentation. Critics of Markdown point out that the many \"flavors\" of Markdown that have developed means Markdown cannot be relied on as a standard for technical communicators. Those who use a particular flavor of Markdown will find that it's more difficult to migrate a large set of Markdown documents to another tool that uses another markup language. Despite some misgivings, Markdown has continued to gain in popularity because it is so useable and easy to learn. In the last few years, there has been more conversation among technical communicators about how to integrate Markdown with other tools that use more complicated markup language. Technical communicators who use both Markdown and DITA want to combine the strengths of both to complete documentation tasks. The Backhoe and The Shovel At the end of a talk at the 2019 Soap! content conference, Patrick Bosek offered the following analogy to explain how DITA and Markdown should be used by technical communicators: \"Markdown is kind of like a shovel and DITA is like a backhoe. And you have these people who have never used a backhoe who are like 'that's way too complex. Why would you ever want to do that?' And then you have people who are construction workers who build big buildings and they're like--Why would you ever use a shovel? You can't build a big building with a shovel. If you're going to start a project by yourself and you don't know how to operate a backhoe, a shovel looks like the obvious answer. We've all used a shovel. But who in [this room] has ever used a backhoe. So they're just different. There's a place in the world for both of them and any construction site that's building something sufficiently large are going to have both of them there. And you don't have people arguing about whether or not we should eliminate shovels or backhoes.\" Patrick Bosek, (Living in Harmony: DITA and Markdown, soap! 2019 conference)","title":"Integrating DITA and Markdown"},{"location":"Integrating%20DITA%20and%20Markdown/#dita-vs-markdown","text":"Technical communicators have sometimes disagreed about whether DITA or Markdown should be used for documentation.

Below are the important concepts I encountered and the projects I completed. Concepts Digital Literacy: the ability to evaluate information and use communication tools in a digital context. Markup Language: A way of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used by technical communicators. Agile: An iterative development process organized as teams-based, non-linear, non-sequential sprints. For more on how technical communicators work in an Agile environment click here . Diataxis: a framework for understanding documentation structure. Four forms of documentation align along two axes of knowledge: theory/practice and acquisition/application . Here is a more detailed look. User Stories: a way to define what a product does by describing an action/goal and focusing on benefits to the user. As this article explains, the simplest user story can be written in a single sentence: \"As a {end user}, I should be able to {action}, so that I can {benefit}.\" GitHub allows for collaboration on code or documents. A project in a shared repository can be altered by multiple people who make changes that are analyzed and approved. Inspired by GitHub functionality, Ann Gentle suggests technical communicators ought to \" treat docs like code \". Every page is page one. All content now exists in an online context where users are able to search quickly for small information chunks. Because of this, technical communicators must consider how to write topics that meet the demands of online readers. Single-sourcing: information designed as content chunks to be used in multiple ways, more than once, and in a variety of contexts,assembled in a document as pieces of a database that can be formed into several outputs. Structured Authoring and XML : a publishing workflow that maintains standardization and a consistent organization of information. Content rules or a style guide may be used to produce elements that conform to an information hierarchy. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to create tags around written content. XML helps implement structured authoring because its specific rules compel a writer to conform to the hierarchical information structure for which XML is designed. Writing with DITA: Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an open XML standard that helps larger companies and organizations reuse content categorized as concept topics, task topics, and reference topics. Here is a helpful guide for writing in DITA.
