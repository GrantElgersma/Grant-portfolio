I took this course in Fall, 2021 to expand my digital literacy, develop competencies in digital writing techniques, and learn to use software documentation tools. Below are the important concepts I encountered and the projects I completed.

###**Concepts**

- Digital Literacy: the ability to evaluate information and use communication tools in a digital context.

- Markup Language: A way of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a lightweight markup language commonly used by technical communicators.

- Agile: An iterative development process organized as teams-based, non-linear, non-sequential sprints. For more on how technical communicators work in an Agile environment [click here](https://www.tcbok.org/designing-and-developing-information/agile-development/).

- Diataxis: a framework for understanding documentation structure. Four forms of documentation align along two axes of knowledge: *theory/practice* and *acquisition/application*. [Here](https://diataxis.fr/introduction/) is a more detailed look. 

- User Stories: a way to define what a product does by describing an action/goal and focusing on benefits to the user. As [this article](https://medium.com/tribalscale/writing-technical-user-stories-434bf96f1dd5) explains, the simplest user story can be written in a single sentence: "As a {end user}, I should be able to {action}, so that I can {benefit}."      

- GitHub allows for collaboration on code or documents. A project in a shared repository can be altered by multiple people who make changes that are analyzed and approved. Inspired by GitHub functionality, Ann Gentle suggests technical communicators ought to "[treat docs like code](https://www.docslikecode.com/articles/github-for-docs/)".

- Every page is page one. All content now exists in an online context where users are able to search quickly for small information chunks. Because of this, technical communicators must consider [how to write topics](https://everypageispageone.com/the-book/) that meet the demands of online readers.   

- Single-sourcing: information designed as content chunks to be used in multiple ways, more than once, and in a variety of contexts,assembled in a document as pieces of a database that can be formed into several outputs.        

- [Structured Authoring and XML](https://docs.deistercloud.com/mediaContent/Axional%20development%20libraries.20/Server%20side%20javascript.50/AX%20Library.10/xml/media/StructuredXMLDoc.pdf): a publishing workflow that maintains standardization and a consistent organization of information. Content rules or a style guide may be used to produce elements that conform to an information hierarchy. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to create tags around written content. XML helps implement structured authoring because its specific rules compel a writer to conform to the hierarchical information structure for which XML is designed.   

- Writing with DITA: Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is an open XML standard that helps larger companies and organizations reuse content categorized as concept topics, task topics, and reference topics. [Here](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/index_frames.html?q=/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/Artefact/Cross_Referencing/c_Related_Links_Section.html) is a helpful guide for writing in DITA.       

###**Projects**

- Digital Literacy [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/d/1NMlptk6gaBjVPajt7WCge6QcxnX4TUWb/p/13CMASMCVK6yNhSnzHku-Zn8IEwkwlolj/edit)

- MkDocs, Markdown, Text Editors (Visual Studio Code)  

- GitHub class collaboration using GitHub Desktop to write explainers, clone and fork a repository, make a pull request, and publish a site.  

- Write DITA topics and Transformation from XML to [PDF output](How to Use Adobe Captivate.pdf) in Oxygen XML

- Final Portfolio Built on MkDocs and Published on GitHub

- Blog post called ["Integrating DITA and Markdown"](Integrating DITA and Markdown.md)

- [Final Digital Literacy Narrative](Final Digital Literacy Narrative.md)
