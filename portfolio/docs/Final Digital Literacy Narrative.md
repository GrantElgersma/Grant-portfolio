In the digital literacy narrative I wrote at the beginning of this course, I focused on my lack of curiosity about computer technology in my early years. Amazingly, this has changed dramatically just in the last few months. Recently, I noticed that most of the YouTube videos that are now suggested for me to watch are tech related. This is because I have been watching a lot of tutorials and explainer videos about topics we've explored in "Writing with Digital Tech" and other classes this semester. 

During lunch, I'm now watching videos on how to use Python to build simple apps and how AI is being used for writing tasks. I'm clicking on reviews of various software tools and  looking up explanations for computer-related terms I've come across in articles and blog posts. Whereas before I might have marveled at the unapproachable nature of the content, now I find myself thinking, "Hmmm, maybe I could try that."

###In the Research Phase
I would say that I'm still in the research phase of my learning, but I've noticed a big shift in my willingness to try out tools that I don't readily understand. Though I may have a long way to go before I would feel really competent using the command line for many computer functions, or building even a simple app, the possibility that I could become good at these things with time seems much more likely in my mind than it did before. 

I had several successes overcoming challenges this semester, all of which helped me to build confidence and trust in my learning process. I've also gotten a better sense of how much there really is to learn, which is daunting, but also has motivated me to think about my learning priorities. How much code do I realistically need to know as a technical communicator? If I'm going to try to learn a bit about markup languages, which ones should I focus on? I realize I don't need to have a software developer's level of knowledge, but knowing terminology, concepts, and basic purposes of tools can be very helpful for a technical communicator.

###Writing as part of information ecosystems
Learning about DITA has had a big effect on my thinking about writing with digital technology. Before encountering DITA, most of my thinking about writing tended to be focused on how information can be organized in individual documents. Understanding how DITA works makes me think of informative written content in terms of architecture and structure in large information ecosystems. I'm now more aware of the technological possibilities for collaborative writing: not only Google Docs, but also DITA and GitHub.

###Mapping out my next steps
This course has given me a sense of the digital writing landscape, or maybe a map of the landscape. I now have choices to make about where to visit next and how much time to spend there. My goal is to follow the model I now have in the "Writing with Digital Tech" page of my static site in order to document other topics and projects I've done in my other classes. The goal is to use this static site to practice using Markdown. 

I learn best when I am working on creative projects or tasks that will bring me tangible or immediate benefits of some kind. MkDocs is a good way to bring together much of the content I've encountered in class. Summarizing what I've learned in just a few sentences for each concept is also a great exercise. While doing this, I noticed gaps in my understanding. If I didn't know how to explain something easily in my own words, I had to go back and reread concepts to make sure I could express them accurately. 

###Entering a conversation
In some ways, this class felt like I had jumped into the middle of an ongoing conversation that has been happening without me for decades now. I'm now trying to catch up on the terminology and get to the foundation of how and why things work the way they do. This semester, I've discovered some of the places where this conversation is taking place: GitHub, Stack Overflow, TechWhirl, I'd Rather Be Writing, and many more. Though I'm still piecing together the references and looking up terms, I'm now curious and engaged, which has always been the place from which, for me, substantial learning begins.
